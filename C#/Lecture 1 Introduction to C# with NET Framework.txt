## **Lecture 1: Introduction to C# with .NET Framework**

### **1. What is C#?**
C# (pronounced as "C-Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by **Microsoft** as part of its **.NET Framework**. It is widely used for developing:
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- Mobile apps
- Game development (Unity)
- Cloud-based applications

ðŸ”¹ **Real-world Example**:  
Think of C# as English grammar. Just like grammar helps in forming correct sentences, C# provides **rules and structures** to write efficient programs.

### **2. What is .NET Framework?**
.NET is a **software development framework** that provides tools, libraries, and runtime environments for running C# applications.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Components of .NET Framework:**
1. **Common Language Runtime (CLR):**  
   - Helps in **executing** C# programs.
   - Manages **memory allocation** and **garbage collection**.
   
2. **Framework Class Library (FCL):**  
   - Provides **predefined classes** and **methods** (like a toolbox) to perform tasks such as:
     - File handling
     - Database connections
     - Web development

3. **ASP.NET:**  
   - Used for building **web applications**.

ðŸ”¹ **Real-world Example**:  
Think of **.NET** as a **smartphone** where different apps (C# programs) can run because the phone provides an **operating system (CLR)** and **pre-installed apps (FCL)**.


### **3. Features of C#**
âœ… **Object-Oriented** â€“ Uses concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance.  
âœ… **Type-Safe** â€“ Prevents invalid memory access.  
âœ… **Garbage Collection** â€“ Automatically manages memory.  
âœ… **Cross-Platform (.NET Core)** â€“ Runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac.  
âœ… **Scalable and Versatile** â€“ Used in enterprise applications, mobile apps, and game development.
