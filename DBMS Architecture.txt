DBMS Architecture
---------------------------------
Definition:
- Architecture = Structure that shows how users, DBMS, and database are connected.
- Common types: 1-Tier, 2-Tier, 3-Tier

---------------------------------
1) 1-Tier Architecture
---------------------------------
- User directly interacts with the database.
- No separation between user and DBMS.
- Used by developers for testing.
Example:
   - SQL commands run directly on MySQL / Oracle console.

Pros:
   - Simple & fast
Cons:
   - Not secure, not for multi-user

---------------------------------
2) 2-Tier Architecture
---------------------------------
- Application (client) communicates directly with DBMS (server).
- Client → Application
- Server → Database

Example:
   - Student Result Application
     Client → Request result
     Server (DBMS) → Returns data

Pros:
   - Faster communication
Cons:
   - Limited scalability (not good for very large systems)

---------------------------------
3) 3-Tier Architecture
---------------------------------
- Adds one more layer (Application Server) between client & DBMS.
- Layers:
   1. Client (User Interface)
   2. Application Server (Business Logic)
   3. Database Server (Data storage)

Example:
   - Banking System
     Client → Login
     Application Server → Process rules (check balance, transaction)
     Database Server → Stores account details

Pros:
   - Secure
   - Scalable (can handle many users)
   - Easier maintenance
Cons:
   - Slightly slower (because of extra layer)

Comparison Table
---------------------------------
Architecture → Layers       → Example         → Use
----------------------------------------------------------
1-Tier       → User + DBMS  → SQL console     → Testing
2-Tier       → Client + DB → Student result   → Small apps
3-Tier       → Client + App + DB → Banking    → Large apps

---------------------------------
Real-Life Analogy
---------------------------------
- 1-Tier → Talking directly to Shop Store Room
- 2-Tier → Talking to Shopkeeper (he brings items from store)
- 3-Tier → Talking to Cashier → Cashier asks Store Manager → Manager gets items from Warehouse
