
##  3] DML Operations in DBMS

**DML = Data Manipulation Language**

###  What it does:

DML commands are used to **work with data inside a table** — like adding, updating, deleting, and viewing data.

 **DML = Change Data** (not structure)
 Works on tables created using **DDL**

---

##  Main DML Commands:

| Command  | Purpose                  |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| `INSERT` | Add new data to a table  |
| `UPDATE` | Modify existing data     |
| `DELETE` | Remove data from a table |
| `SELECT` | View data from a table   |

---

##  Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine your table is like a **register** (notebook) for student details.
You’ve already created it using DDL. Now you want to fill or change the information.

---

###  1. `INSERT` – Add New Data

 **Example:**

INSERT INTO Students (RollNo, Name, Course, Age)
VALUES (101, 'Amit', 'BCA', 20);

**Real-Life Meaning:**
You **write a new entry** in your register for a new student.

---

###  2. `SELECT` – View Data

**Example:**

SELECT * FROM Students;

**Real-Life Meaning:**
You **read all student entries** from the register.

You can also select specific columns:

SELECT Name, Course FROM Students;


---

###  3. `UPDATE` – Change Existing Data

**Example:**

UPDATE Students
SET Age = 21
WHERE RollNo = 101;

**Real-Life Meaning:**
You **update the student’s age** in the register (change a value).

---

###  4. `DELETE` – Remove Data

**Example:**

DELETE FROM Students
WHERE RollNo = 101;

**Real-Life Meaning:**
You **erase the row** of that student from the register.

##  Summary Table:

| DML Command | Use For              | Real-World Example            |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `INSERT`    | Add new records      | Add a student to the register |
| `SELECT`    | View data            | Read data from the register   |
| `UPDATE`    | Modify existing data | Change a student’s age        |
| `DELETE`    | Remove specific data | Remove a student’s record     |
