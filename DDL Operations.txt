##  2] DDL Operations in DBMS

**DDL = Data Definition Language**

###  What it does:

DDL commands are used to **create**, **modify**, or **delete the structure** of a database (like tables, schemas, etc.).

It **does not manage data** inside the table — it **manages the structure** of the table.

##  Main DDL Commands:

| Command    | Purpose                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CREATE`   | To create a new table/database                         |
| `ALTER`    | To modify an existing table                            |
| `DROP`     | To delete a table/database                             |
| `TRUNCATE` | To delete all data from a table, but not the structure |
| `RENAME`   | To change the table name                               |

##  Let's Understand with Real-World Examples:

Imagine you're the admin of a **college database system**, and you want to manage student records.

---

### 1. `CREATE` – Creating a Table

**Example:**
You want to create a new table to store student info.

CREATE TABLE Students (
  RollNo INT,
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Course VARCHAR(30),
  Age INT
);

**Real Life Meaning:**
You made a **new notebook** with specific columns to store student data.

---

###  2. `ALTER` – Changing a Table

**Example:**
You decide to add a **new column** for Email.

ALTER TABLE Students ADD Email VARCHAR(50);

**Real Life Meaning:**
You added a **new column** in your notebook to write student email addresses.

You can also **remove or rename** columns with ALTER.

---

###  3. `DROP` – Deleting a Table

**Example:**
You no longer need the “Students” table.

DROP TABLE Students;

**Real Life Meaning:**
You **threw away the entire notebook** with student data and structure — nothing is left.

---

###  4. `TRUNCATE` – Empty the Table

**Example:**
You want to remove all student records but keep the table for future use.

TRUNCATE TABLE Students;

**Real Life Meaning:**
You **erased all the pages inside** the notebook, but kept the notebook structure.

---

###  5. `RENAME` – Rename the Table

**Example:**
You want to rename the “Students” table to “StudentRecords”.

RENAME TABLE Students TO StudentRecords;

**Real Life Meaning:**
You **changed the label** on the front of the notebook from “Students” to “StudentRecords”.

| DDL Command | Action                               | Real World Meaning                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| CREATE      | Make a new table                     | Create new notebook               |
| ALTER       | Modify structure (add/remove column) | Add new column/page in notebook   |
| DROP        | Delete the whole table               | Throw away the entire notebook    |
| TRUNCATE    | Delete data only                     | Erase all pages but keep notebook |
| RENAME      | Change table name                    | Change the notebook's label       |
