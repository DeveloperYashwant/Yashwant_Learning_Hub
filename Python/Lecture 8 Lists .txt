### **Lecture 8: Real-World Example of Lists in Python**

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. They are ordered, changeable (mutable), and allow duplicate values.

---

### **Real-World Example: Student Management System**

Imagine a school wants to manage a list of students enrolled in a course. They need to:
1. Add new students.
2. Remove a student.
3. Display the list of enrolled students.
4. Find a specific student.
5. Sort the list alphabetically.

---

#### **Step 1: Create an Empty List**

students = []  # Initial empty list

---

#### **Step 2: Add New Students**

# Adding students to the list
students.append("Yashwant")
students.append("Riya")
students.append("Aman")
students.append("Nisha")

print("Enrolled Students:", students)

**Output:**

Enrolled Students: ['Yashwant', 'Riya', 'Aman', 'Nisha']

---

#### **Step 3: Remove a Student**

# Removing a student who left the course
students.remove("Aman")
print("Updated Students List:", students)

**Output:**

Updated Students List: ['Yashwant', 'Riya', 'Nisha']

---

#### **Step 4: Display the List of Students**

print("Total Enrolled Students:")
for student in students:
    print(student)

**Output:**

Total Enrolled Students:
Yashwant
Riya
Nisha

---

#### **Step 5: Find a Specific Student**

search_name = "Riya"
if search_name in students:
    print(f"{search_name} is enrolled.")
else:
    print(f"{search_name} is not found.")

**Output:**

Riya is enrolled.

---

#### **Step 6: Sort the Students Alphabetically**

students.sort()
print("Sorted Students List:", students)

**Output:**

Sorted Students List: ['Nisha', 'Riya', 'Yashwant']

---

### **Additional List Operations in the Student Management System**

1. **Insert a Student at a Specific Position:**

students.insert(1, "Tina")
print("After Insertion:", students)

**Output:**

After Insertion: ['Nisha', 'Tina', 'Riya', 'Yashwant']

2. **Count the Number of Students:**

print("Number of Students:", len(students))

**Output:**

Number of Students: 4

3. **Clear the List (if the course is canceled):**

students.clear()
print("All students removed:", students)

**Output:**

All students removed: []

---

### **Student Practice:**
1. Write a program to add 5 students to a list and then print the list in reverse order.
2. Create a list of 5 subjects and print each subject using a loop.
3. Write a function to remove duplicate student names from a list.

### **Example 2**

#### **Scenario: Grocery Shopping List**

Imagine you are preparing a list of groceries to buy from the supermarket. You need to:
1. Add items to your list.
2. Remove items once bought.
3. Check if an item is already on the list.
4. View the final list before shopping.

---

#### **Step 1: Create an Empty List**

grocery_list = []  # Initial empty list

---

#### **Step 2: Add Items to the Grocery List**

# Adding items to the list
grocery_list.append("Milk")
grocery_list.append("Eggs")
grocery_list.append("Bread")
grocery_list.append("Butter")

print("Grocery List:", grocery_list)

**Output:**

Grocery List: ['Milk', 'Eggs', 'Bread', 'Butter']

---

#### **Step 3: Remove an Item After Buying**

# Removing an item after purchasing it
grocery_list.remove("Bread")
print("Updated Grocery List:", grocery_list)

**Output:**

Updated Grocery List: ['Milk', 'Eggs', 'Butter']

---

#### **Step 4: Check if an Item is on the List**

item_to_check = "Eggs"
if item_to_check in grocery_list:
    print(f"{item_to_check} is on the list.")
else:
    print(f"{item_to_check} is not on the list.")

**Output:**

Eggs is on the list.

---

#### **Step 5: View the Final List Before Shopping**

print("Final Grocery List:")
for item in grocery_list:
    print(f"- {item}")

**Output:**

Final Grocery List:
- Milk
- Eggs
- Butter

---

#### **Step 6: Sort the List Alphabetically**

grocery_list.sort()
print("Sorted Grocery List:", grocery_list)

**Output:**

Sorted Grocery List: ['Butter', 'Eggs', 'Milk']

---

#### **Bonus: Adding Multiple Items at Once**

# Using extend() to add multiple items
grocery_list.extend(["Fruits", "Vegetables", "Cheese"])
print("Extended Grocery List:", grocery_list)

**Output:**

Extended Grocery List: ['Butter', 'Eggs', 'Milk', 'Fruits', 'Vegetables', 'Cheese']

---

### **Student Practice:**
1. Write a program to add your top 5 favorite movies to a list and print them.
2. Create a list of tasks for the day and mark them as completed by removing them one by one.
3. Write a function to find the longest word in a given list of words.
