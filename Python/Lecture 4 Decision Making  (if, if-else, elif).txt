### **Lecture 4: Decision Making in Python (if, if-else, elif)**  

---

#### **Introduction:**  
Decision-making statements in Python allow the program to make decisions based on conditions. These statements control the flow of execution based on whether a condition is `True` or `False`.  


### **1. if Statement:**  
The `if` statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is `True`.  

**Syntax:**  

if condition:
    statement(s)

**Real-World Example:**  
Checking if a person is eligible to vote:  

age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")

**Output:**  

Eligible to vote

---

### **2. if-else Statement:**  
The `if-else` statement executes one block of code if the condition is `True`, and another block if the condition is `False`.  

**Syntax:**  

if condition:
    statement(s) if true
else:
    statement(s) if false

**Real-World Example:**  
Checking if a number is even or odd:  

num = 7
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even Number")
else:
    print("Odd Number")

**Output:**  

Odd Number

---

### **3. if-elif-else Statement:**  
The `if-elif-else` ladder is used when there are multiple conditions to check. It checks conditions one by one and executes the first block that is `True`.  

**Syntax:**  

if condition1:
    statement(s) for condition1
elif condition2:
    statement(s) for condition2
else:
    statement(s) if none are true

**Real-World Example:**  
Grading system based on marks:  

marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A+")
elif marks >= 80:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 70:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: Fail")

**Output:**  

Grade: A

---

### **4. Nested if Statement:**  
You can place an `if` statement inside another `if` statement. This is called nested if.  

**Syntax:**  

if condition1:
    if condition2:
        statement(s) for both true

**Real-World Example:**  
Checking eligibility to vote and country of residence:  

age = 20
citizenship = "India"

if age >= 18:
    if citizenship == "India":
        print("Eligible to vote in India")
    else:
        print("Not eligible to vote in India")
else:
    print("Not old enough to vote")

**Output:**  

Eligible to vote in India

---

### **5. One-Line if Statement:**  
If you have a single statement to execute, you can write it on one line.  

**Syntax:**  

print("Positive") if num > 0 else print("Negative")

**Real-World Example:**  
Check if a number is positive or negative:  

num = -5
print("Positive") if num > 0 else print("Negative")

**Output:**  

Negative

---

### **6. if with Multiple Conditions:**  
You can use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) with the `if` statement.  

**Real-World Example:**  
Checking for a valid username and password:  

username = "admin"
password = "1234"

if username == "admin" and password == "1234":
    print("Login successful")
else:
    print("Invalid credentials")

**Output:**  

Login successful

---

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**  
1. **Missing Colon:**  
   - Always put a colon `:` after the condition.  

   if age >= 18    # Incorrect
   if age >= 18:   # Correct

2. **Indentation Errors:**  
   - Indentation is crucial in Python to define the scope.  

   if age >= 18:
   print("Eligible")    # Incorrect
   if age >= 18:
       print("Eligible") # Correct

3. **Improper Use of elif:**  
   - Use `elif` only after an `if` statement.

### **Real-World Scenario:**  
#### **Electricity Bill Calculation:**  
Calculate the electricity bill based on units consumed:  
- Units <= 100: ₹3 per unit  
- Units <= 200: ₹5 per unit  
- Units > 200: ₹8 per unit  

**Code:**  

units = 180

if units <= 100:
    bill = units * 3
elif units <= 200:
    bill = (100 * 3) + (units - 100) * 5
else:
    bill = (100 * 3) + (100 * 5) + (units - 200) * 8

print(f"Electricity Bill: ₹{bill}")

**Output:**  

Electricity Bill: ₹800
==============================


### **Real-World Examples of Decision Making  

---

#### **1. ATM Withdrawal System:**  
Check if a user has sufficient balance before allowing a withdrawal.  

balance = 5000
withdraw_amount = 3000

if withdraw_amount <= balance:
    balance -= withdraw_amount
    print(f"Withdrawal successful! Remaining balance: ₹{balance}")
else:
    print("Insufficient balance!")

**Output:**  

Withdrawal successful! Remaining balance: ₹2000

---

#### **2. Traffic Light System:**  
Display the action based on the color of the traffic light.  

light_color = "Red"

if light_color == "Green":
    print("Go")
elif light_color == "Yellow":
    print("Slow down")
elif light_color == "Red":
    print("Stop")
else:
    print("Invalid light color")

**Output:**  
Stop

---

#### **3. Online Shopping Discount:**  
Calculate the final price after applying a discount based on the purchase amount.  

purchase_amount = 1200

if purchase_amount >= 1000:
    discount = 0.1 * purchase_amount  # 10% discount
elif purchase_amount >= 500:
    discount = 0.05 * purchase_amount  # 5% discount
else:
    discount = 0  # No discount

final_price = purchase_amount - discount
print(f"Final Price after discount: ₹{final_price}")

**Output:**  
Final Price after discount: ₹1080.0

---

#### **4. Movie Ticket Pricing:**  
Calculate ticket price based on age group.  

age = 15

if age < 12:
    ticket_price = 50
elif age <= 18:
    ticket_price = 75
elif age <= 60:
    ticket_price = 100
else:
    ticket_price = 60

print(f"Ticket Price: ₹{ticket_price}")

**Output:**  

Ticket Price: ₹75

---

#### **5. Student Grade Calculation:**  
Assign a grade based on the percentage scored.  

percentage = 82

if percentage >= 90:
    grade = "A+"
elif percentage >= 80:
    grade = "A"
elif percentage >= 70:
    grade = "B"
elif percentage >= 60:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "Fail"

print(f"Your Grade: {grade}")

**Output:**  

Your Grade: A

#### **6. Food Ordering System:**  
Display the food menu based on the cuisine selected.  


cuisine = "Italian"

if cuisine == "Indian":
    print("Biryani, Butter Chicken, Paneer Tikka")
elif cuisine == "Chinese":
    print("Noodles, Manchurian, Fried Rice")

    print("Pizza, Pasta, Risotto")
else:
    print("Cuisine not available")

**Output:**  

Pizza, Pasta, Risotto

#### **7. Temperature Check:**  
Suggest what to wear based on the temperature.  


temperature = 15

if temperature > 30:
    print("Wear light clothes")
elif 20 <= temperature <= 30:
    print("Wear comfortable clothes")
elif 10 <= temperature < 20:
    print("Wear a jacket")
else:
    print("Wear a coat and scarf")

**Output:**  

Wear a jacket

#### **8. Exam Result:**  
Determine if the student has passed or failed.  

marks = 45

if marks >= 40:
    print("Pass")
else:
    print("Fail")

**Output:**  
Pass

---

#### **9. Online Food Delivery Status:**  
Check the status of the delivery.  

status = "Delivered"

    print("Your order has been placed.")
elif status == "Dispatched":
    print("Your order is on the way.")
elif status == "Delivered":
    print("Your order has arrived.")
else:
    print("Invalid status")

**Output:**  

Your order has arrived.
