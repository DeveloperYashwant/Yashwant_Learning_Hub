### Lecture 1: Introduction to Spring Boot

#### 1. **What is Spring Boot?**
   - **Spring Boot** is an open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It simplifies the development of Java applications by providing out-of-the-box configurations and tools to minimize setup time.
   - It is built on top of the **Spring Framework** and uses its core principles like **dependency injection**, **aspect-oriented programming**, and **transaction management**.
   - Spring Boot eliminates the need for extensive configuration and allows developers to focus on writing business logic instead of worrying about setting up complex configurations.

#### 2. **Why Use Spring Boot?**
   - **Convention over Configuration**: Spring Boot comes with a lot of default configurations, reducing the amount of setup and configuration developers need to do.
   - **Standalone Applications**: You can create executable JAR (Java ARchive) or WAR (Web Application Archive) files, which simplifies deployment.
   - **Embedded Servers**: Spring Boot comes with built-in support for embedded servers like **Tomcat**, **Jetty**, and **Undertow**, meaning you don't need to deploy your application on an external server.
   - **Microservices Support**: It is designed to work well with microservice architectures.
   - **Spring Boot Starter Projects**: Provides pre-configured templates for different types of applications like web apps, data-driven apps, messaging apps, etc.

#### 3. **Spring Boot Architecture**
   - **Application Class**: The entry point of the Spring Boot application. It is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`.
   - **Spring Boot Auto-Configuration**: Automatically configures Spring application based on the dependencies in the project.
   - **Embedded Servers**: Spring Boot includes embedded servers, so you don't need a separate web server like Apache Tomcat.
   - **Spring Boot Starters**: Pre-configured modules to help set up common functionality (like `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`, etc.).
   - **Spring Boot Actuator**: Provides insights into the application, such as health checks, metrics, etc.

#### 4. **Spring Boot Key Features**
   - **Auto Configuration**: Automatically configures the application based on the libraries you have added to the project.
   - **Spring Boot Starter**: Pre-configured templates that simplify adding functionality to applications (e.g., web apps, data apps).
   - **Production Ready**: Includes features like health checks, metrics, and monitoring via Spring Boot Actuator.
   - **Minimal Configuration**: You don't need to write complex XML configuration files, and you can run your application with just one main class.
   - **Embedded Server**: No need to deploy your application on an external server. It can run directly in an embedded server like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow.

#### 5. **Spring Boot vs Traditional Spring Framework**
   - **Traditional Spring Framework**: Requires heavy XML-based configurations or annotation-based configurations. You need to set up external servers and manually configure many aspects.
   - **Spring Boot**: Simplifies everything. It auto-configures the app, provides embedded servers, and uses minimal configuration to get things up and running quickly.

#### 6. **Setting Up a Spring Boot Project**
   - **Step 1: Create a Spring Boot Project**
     - The easiest way to set up a Spring Boot project is through **Spring Initializr** (https://start.spring.io/).
     - You can specify your project metadata (Group, Artifact, Name), dependencies (Web, JPA, etc.), and generate a project structure that you can import into your IDE.
   - **Step 2: Add Dependencies**
     - Add relevant dependencies like `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`, etc.
   - **Step 3: Create the Main Application Class**
     - This class is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` and contains the `public static void main(String[] args)` method, which launches the application.

#### 7. **Creating Your First Spring Boot Application**
   - **Example Application: A Simple REST API**

 java
   package com.example.demo;

   import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
   import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

   @SpringBootApplication
   public class DemoApplication {

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
       }
   }

   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api")
   class HelloController {

       @GetMapping("/hello")
       public String sayHello() {
           return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
       }
   }

   - **Explanation**:
     - The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation marks the main class to launch the Spring Boot application.
     - The `@RestController` annotation makes the `HelloController` class a REST API endpoint.
     - The `@RequestMapping("/api")` is the base path for the controller.
     - The `@GetMapping("/hello")` defines a GET request handler that returns "Hello, Spring Boot!" when accessed via `/api/hello`.

#### 8. **Running the Application**
   - Run the application by executing the main class, `DemoApplication`, in your IDE or using the command line with `mvn spring-boot:run`.
   - By default, the application will run on `http://localhost:8080`.

#### 9. **Conclusion**
   - Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal setup.
   - It simplifies configurations, offers embedded servers, and promotes microservices architecture.
   - With the Spring Initializr, it is easier than ever to get started with Spring Boot development.
