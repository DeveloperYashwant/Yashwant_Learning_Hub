### **Lecture 10: SQL Subqueries (Query inside a Query)**


## **1. What is a Subquery?**

- A **subquery** is a **query inside another query**.
- It helps to perform complex filtering, calculation, or selection.
- **Inner query** runs first, and its result is used by the **outer query**.

---

## **2. Syntax of Subquery**

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name = (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
```

- **Inner Query**: (SELECT ...)
- **Outer Query**: SELECT ... WHERE ...

---

## **3. Where Can We Use Subqueries?**

- In the **WHERE** clause
- In the **FROM** clause
- In the **SELECT** clause

---

## **4. Example Table**

**Students Table**

| StudentID | Name  | Marks |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1         | John  | 85    |
| 2         | Alice | 92    |
| 3         | Bob   | 78    |
| 4         | Sam   | 88    |

---

## **5. Subquery in WHERE Clause**

**Find students who scored the highest marks.**

```sql
SELECT Name, Marks
FROM Students
WHERE Marks = (SELECT MAX(Marks) FROM Students);
```

âœ… **Explanation:**
- The **inner query** finds the maximum marks (92).
- The **outer query** finds the student with those marks (Alice).

---

## **6. Subquery in FROM Clause**

**Find the average of the highest marks.**

```sql
SELECT AVG(MaxMarks)
FROM (SELECT MAX(Marks) AS MaxMarks FROM Students) AS Temp;
```

âœ… **Explanation:**
- Inner query gets Max Marks (92).
- Outer query takes AVG (in this case, same as 92).

---

## **7. Subquery in SELECT Clause**

**Show each student's marks along with the highest mark.**

```sql
SELECT Name, Marks,
(SELECT MAX(Marks) FROM Students) AS HighestMarks
FROM Students;
```

âœ… **Explanation:**
- For each student, it shows their marks **+** the overall highest marks.

---

## **8. Types of Subqueries**

| Type | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| Single Row Subquery | Returns one value |
| Multiple Row Subquery | Returns multiple values |
| Multiple Column Subquery | Returns multiple columns |
| Correlated Subquery | Subquery depends on outer query |

---

## **9. Example of Correlated Subquery**

**Find students who scored more than the average marks.**

```sql
SELECT Name, Marks
FROM Students AS S1
WHERE Marks > (SELECT AVG(Marks) FROM Students WHERE StudentID = S1.StudentID);
```

- Here, **inner query depends** on each **row of outer query**.

---

## **10. Important Points**

- **Inner query runs first**.
- Enclose subqueries in **parentheses** ( ).
- Subqueries can be used **with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE**.
- Use aliases (Temp, T1, etc.) for **better readability**.

---

## **11. Real-Life Example**

**Banking System Example:**

- Find customers who have the highest savings balance.
- Find employees who earn more than the average salary.

**All use subqueries!** âœ…

## **12. Practice for Students**

ðŸ”¥ **Try These:**

1. Find the student with minimum marks using a subquery.
2. List all students whose marks are greater than 80 using a subquery.
3. Show each studentâ€™s marks and the total marks of all students using a subquery.
